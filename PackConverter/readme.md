**PackConverter**

A bunch of spaghetti code that converts 1.19 / 1.20 resource packs to a format compatible with version 1.8. This was mainly tested on PVP texture packs, so the success rate of conversion may vary, especially for packs that rely heavily on JSON models.


**Dependencies**

Python
PIL
shutil
glob


**Steps to Use**

1. Unzip PackConverter.zip into a folder.
2. Place a resource pack of choice into the same folder. 
3. Run PackConverter.py. Input the resource pack name to convert.
4. The script will output a new pack compatible with Minecraft 1.8.
